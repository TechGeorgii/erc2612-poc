# This is a simplest React app for Ethereum experiments

It was created since I got tired spending time building new React test app from scratch every time I needed to do some
experiments with Ethereum/Metamask.

Features:

- Connect wallet (like Metamask)
- Getting current address USDT balance
- ERC20 ABI included

## Installation

In the project directory, you should run the following commands:

### `npm i`

It will install required dependencies.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).\

It uses [Ethers.js V6](https://docs.ethers.org/v6/)
